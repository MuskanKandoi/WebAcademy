# Fake E-Commerce

## Description

The goal of this project was to develop a mini e-commerce platform utilizing React's router. The main objective was to create an interface where users could browse products fetched from a faux catalog through API calls. Alongside this functionality, users should have the ability to dynamically add and remove items from their shopping cart. Additionally, I took the opportunity to implement responsiveness for the first time, ensuring the site adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

## Struggle Points

I encountered the most difficulty with using the router, particularly in figuring out how to structure the components. Initially, I struggled with deciding whether to place all components as children of a main directory or to create separate directories for each individual page. Additionally, I found that passing props to deeply nested components could become a tedious and repetitive task. This is something I plan to examine further for future projects, as it can impact code organization and efficiency.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed watching this project evolve into something that can finally be considered a real-world project. I've gained a lot more proficiency with React and its functionalities, and I believe I've done a good job with responsiveness, which I had never implemented before.

In the project, I still need to implement the input validation part, thus not allowing the user to enter quantities less than 1 for each selected product.
